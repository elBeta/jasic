About
-----

Jasic is an exercise in simplicity and pedagogy. It is a complete standalone
interpreter for a dialect of the original BASIC language that fits inside a
single .java file. It handles tokenizing, parsing, interpreting, output,
variables, expressions, and flow control, like a full-scale compiler or
interpreter, just in miniature. I tried to keep the code simple and readable
while still being terse.

If you've ever wanted a gentle introduction to how programming languages work
under the hood, Jasic is a good place to start.


Getting Started
---------------

You can build Jasic using your big IDE of choice, but the simplest way is just
through the command line. Open a command prompt and navigate to the main Jasic
directory (where this file is), then do:

> javac com/stuffwithstuff/Jasic.java

This compiles the code. To run it, enter:

> java com.stuffwithstuff.Jasic <script>

Where it says <script> fill in the path to some .jas file containing Jasic code.
Here's one:

> java com.stuffwithstuff.Jasic sample/mandel.jas

More Info
---------

The real information about Jasic, including the language syntax and how the
interpreter works is all in with the code, so go ahead and read through
Jasic.java.
